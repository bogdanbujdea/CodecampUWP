A growing number of people now talk to their mobile smart phones, asking them to send e-mail and text messages, search for directions, or find information on the Web. Now the rapid rise of powerful mobile devices is making voice interfaces even more useful and pervasive. Speech is ideally suited to mobile computing because a single spoken command can accomplish tasks that would normally require a multitude of swipes and presses. In this presentation we will try to see how we can make a mobile hybrid application driven by voice commands, using technologies like Apache Cordova mobile development framework, HTML5, Javascript and Google Voice Recognition API.",

Unperceptibly, what used to be a small and easily manageable collection of components becomes a mass of indecipherable legacy code. Luckily, these types of problems are not new, and the industry literature is abundant with materials on the topic, albeit oftentimes for other technologies. In this talk, Paul brings some of these proven solutions to the JavaScript world, providing the audience with real-world examples of managing code complexity to ensure developers keep sane and new features get shipped in reasonable time.",

There is no preparing for finding emotional serenity or being emotionally intelligent when you work in an Agile team. There is no certificate to earn, no pill to take to make the rough feelings that slow you down, hold you back, making you less productive go away. You’re on your own. It is never easy. And how you react to your emotions will have profound consequences for your team. I invite you to join me in a journey of self-exploration and discovery to learn some practical ways to look at your own behavior within the context of the team and gain self-understanding and insight into your behavior and how this behavior affect your team members.

Despite this, in the last 10+ years java language designers and java libraries developers have been very busy trying to push the most relevant and most needed tools to evolve it in the right direction, while keeping intact the core ‘spirit’: that stability, quality and consistency that everyone in the IT world knows and appreciate. However, as developers in the cold real world out there, unluckily we have to deliver projects rather than play with language features. This is why, more often than not, most of these new features go severely under-utilized, sometimes even completely ignored by developers, newbies and ‘veterans’ alike. Of course, this is surely due also to that inherent lag in adopting newer version of the JVM in the enterprise that we all know about. Nevertheless if we are honest, that is not the full picture: we also have to blame ourselves, and our often static mindset to stick to what we know already and have been using in the past, rather than looking for a newer, better way to do things. I will try to motivate you to refresh your java skills, by having a short journey over the last 10 years in Java development, going through each new version of Java SE (6, 7, 8), to see some of the best and/or most hidden features that came along with each new java release. Meanwhile, we will also get a glimpse of what will come and what the the future holds for us with Java 9.",

O discuție despre părțile dureroase ale învățării, despre ceea ce ne schimbă cu adevărat, și despre cum trecem prin transformările care contează. Când învățarea încetează să mai fie jucărie și devine identitate. Când intrăm în acel joc în care avem multe de pierdut. Cum o facem? De ce lucruri are rost să ne temem, și de care nu?",
